            <h1>Just a small town boy</h1>
            <p>Born on Februrary 1st, 1994, Harry Edward Styles was born to parents Anne Twist and Desmond Styles in Redditch, Worcestershire, England. When he was a child, he moved with his parents and older sister, Gemma, to the village of Holmes Chapel in Cheshire. His parents divorced when he was seven years old and his mother later remarried to business partner John Cox;the Coxes divorced years later. Styles said he had a "great childhood" and was always supported by his parents. As a child, he recorded covers on a karaoke machine he was given by his grandfather, and the first song he recorded was Elvis Presley's "The Girl of My Best Friend". Styles attended Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School, where he was the lead singer for the band White Eskimo, which won a local Battle of the Bands competition. At the age of 16, he worked part-time at the W. Mandeville Bakery in Holmes Chapel. </p>

            <h1>On his Inluences</h1>
            <p>Upon listening to Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon as a child, he said he "couldn't really get it, but I just remember being like â€“ this is really fucking cool." He has also cited Freddie Mercury, Elvis Presley, and Paul McCartney (including his side project Wings) as influences, while mentioning Shania Twain as his main inspiration both musically and in fashion.
            Styles's musical style has been described as soft rock, pop, and rock, with elements of folk and Britpop. The musical style on his debut solo album was described as a "mish-mash of Los Angeles' style classic rock and ballads" by NME, invoking an "intimately emotional Seventies soft-rock vibe" by Rolling Stone, and "synthesis influences from the last half-century of rock" by Time magazine. His debut album was influenced by the music he grew up listening to, such as Pink Floyd, The Rolling Stones, The Beatles and Fleetwood Mac, as well as the songwriting of Harry Nilsson.Styles praised Nilsson's lyrics as being "honest, and so good, and I think it's because he's never trying to sound clever." 
            Styles's favourite album is Astral Weeks by Northern Irish musician Van Morrison, which he called "completely perfect"; he also considers Etta James's album At Last! to be "perfect". Joni Mitchell's seminal 1971 album Blue inspired Styles to contact the album's dulcimer instrumentalist who in turn worked with him on Fine Line.</p>
