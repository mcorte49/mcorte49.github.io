            <h1>"Treat People With Kindness"</h1>
            <p>A phrase originally coined by a young Styles early on in his musical career is now not only the title of one of his hit songs off his most recent album, Fine Line, but it's a movement. He said the meaning behind Treat People With Kindness is “universal”. “Small changes end up making a big difference,” he said. “It's about being a lot nicer to each other rather than, 'Don't do this, or don't do that, not this yes that. ' It's just saying, 'Treat people with kindness,' you know.” </p>

            <p>Not only is he known for writing and performing heartfelt songs about intense emotions, but he also brings life to other stylings as well. All around, in his very own words, "I was born to entertain".</p>

            <p>"Treat People with Kindness", also abbreviated to "TPWK", is a slogan used by Styles to promote his message of love, acceptance, and kindness to people.Styles started using the slogan on his debut concert tour in 2017, on a badge on his guitar, and on tour merchandise including Pride T-shirts sold to raise funds for GLSEN. In a December 2019 interview he said, "It was a pin I had on my guitar strap and we made T-shirts for it, then I saw a lot of T-shirts around. I'd be driving or something and see someone in one and I started feeling like, 'Oh this is a bit of a thing'". This gave Styles the idea of writing a song to go with the slogan titled "Treat People with Kindness", which is the penultimate track on his second studio album, Fine Line.

            In October 2019, teaser posters including the phrase "Do you know who you are?" and the acronym "TPWK" were spotted in London, Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Australia; fans were able to connect the posters to Styles and his new album release because of the reference to his "Treat People with Kindness" motto. At the same time, to mark World Mental Health Day, Styles launched a website bot called "Do You Know Who You Are?" that gives users positive randomised messages using words such as 'bright', 'determined', 'loving', and 'wonderful', and ending with "TPWK. LOVE, H".</p>
