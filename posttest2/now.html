            <h1>What is Harry up to now?</h1>
            <p>As a solo artist, Styles joined Jeffrey Azoff's Full Stop Management as well as talent agency CAA, and signed a recording contract with Columbia Records in the first half of 2016. Around this time, he also launched his own record label, Erskine Records. Recording for Styles's debut album took place throughout 2016 in Los Angeles, London, and Port Antonio, Jamaica, where Styles and his collaborators had a two-month writing retreat in the autumn. In March 2017, he announced that his first solo single, "Sign of the Times", would be released on 7 April.The song went on to peak at number one on the UK Singles Chart and at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. It is a glam rock-influenced soft rock power ballad, and has drawn comparisons with the work of David Bowie. Rolling Stone ranked it as the best song of 2017.Its music video featured Styles flying and walking on water,and won the Brit Award for British Video of the Year.In April, Styles was a musical guest on Saturday Night Live in the US, and made his debut televised solo performance in his native country on The Graham Norton Show. </p>
            <p>His self-titled debut album was released in May 2017,whereupon it debuted at number one in several countries, including Australia, the UK and the US. The record was influenced by 1970s soft rock and was described by Variety as a "classic cocktail of psychedelia, Britpop, and balladry". The album received generally favourable reviews from critics,and was included in several publications' lists of the best albums of 2017. Harry Styles yielded two more singles, "Two Ghosts" and "Kiwi". The film, Harry Styles: Behind the Album, which documented the writing and recording process for the album, was also released in May exclusively on Apple Music. Styles embarked on his first headlining concert tour, Harry Styles: Live on Tour, from September 2017 through to July 2018, performing in North and South Americas, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The tour setlist included covers of Fleetwood Mac's "The Chain", several One Direction songs, as well as previously unreleased material.</p>

            "Lights Up", the lead single from Styles's second album, Fine Line, was released in October 2019, debuting in third place in the UK.The song features a "soft-touch re-entry into the pop slipstream" according to music writer Jon Caramanica.Styles performed "double duty" as host and musical guest on Saturday Night Live in November. The second single preceding Fine Line, "Adore You", was released in December, peaking at number seven in the UK and at number six in the US. Styles also once again guest hosted The Late Late Show with James Corden that month.

            Fine Line followed on 13 December. The album was recorded at the Shangri-La studio in Malibu, California, with the same production team behind Styles's debut album, and features a similar sound sonically to Harry Styles, while incorporating additional elements of funk and soul.It received generally positive reviews from critics.The album peaked at number two in the UK, and topped the US charts, breaking the record as the biggest sales debut from an English male artist in the US since Nielsen SoundScan tracking began in 1991.Singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks, who referred to Styles as "the son [she] never had", likened Fine Line to Fleetwood Mac's album Rumours and commented that it inspired her to write new music. Rolling Stone ranked it at number 491 in their 2020 list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". Four other singles, "Falling", "Watermelon Sugar", "Golden" and "Treat People with Kindness", were released from the album."Watermelon Sugar" became Styles's fourth UK top-ten single, charting at number four, as well as his first number-one single in the US. A tour to support Fine Line, entitled Love On Tour, was set to take place throughout 2020.Styles has postponed the European and North American legs of the tour until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

            At the 2020 Brit Awards, Styles was nominated for British Male Solo Artist and British Album of the Year. In March 2020, he performed an NPR Tiny Desk concert,and in July, he narrated a bedtime story titled Dream with Me for the relaxation app Calm. Later that year, Styles received the Favorite Pop/Rock Album for Fine Line at the 48th American Music Awards,the Best International Artist at the 34th ARIA Music Awards, and the Chart Achievement at the 27th Billboard Music Awards. He was also named Variety's Hitmaker of the Year. At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in March 2021, he received three nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album (Fine Line), Best Pop Solo Performance ("Watermelon Sugar") and Best Music Video ("Adore You"), winning Best Pop Solo Performance."Watermelon Sugar" also earned him his second Brit Award for British Single of the Year during the 2021 ceremony . At the 2021 Ivor Novello Awards, "Adore You" won the award for Most Performed Work.
